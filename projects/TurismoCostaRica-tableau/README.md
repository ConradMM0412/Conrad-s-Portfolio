# Tourism in Costa Rica — Tableau Project

**Business Problem**  
Tourism is one of Costa Rica’s main economic drivers. The goal of this project is to analyze tourism flows, visitor origins, and seasonal patterns to identify opportunities for growth and marketing focus.

**Dataset**  
- Source: [add link or describe dataset]  
- Main fields: country of origin, year/month, number of visitors, type of tourism (eco, beach, adventure).  
- Size: [number of rows/records].  

**Methodology**  
1. Data cleaning and preparation (Excel/Power Query).  
2. Import into Tableau.  
3. Built dashboards for:
   - Monthly arrivals trend.
   - Visitors by country of origin.
   - Tourism type distribution.
   - Seasonal heatmaps.  

**Key Insights**  
- [Insight 1: e.g., High season between Dec–April due to North America arrivals.]  
- [Insight 2: e.g., Adventure tourism is growing fastest in EU visitors.]  
- [Insight 3: e.g., Beach tourism dominates Pacific provinces.]  

**Visualizations**  
_Add 2–3 screenshots of Tableau dashboards here (place them inside `/projects/turismo-cr-tableau/imgs/`)._

**Recommendations**  
- Invest in promoting eco-tourism in off-season months.  
- Target marketing for EU adventure travelers.  

**Next Steps**  
- Add forecasting models for future arrivals.  
- Compare tourism revenues with climate data.
